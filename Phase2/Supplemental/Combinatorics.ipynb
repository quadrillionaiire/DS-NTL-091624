    "\n",
    "> Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the relations characterizing sets, subsets, lists, and multisets.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Sometimes combinatorics is said to be the branch of math that deals with counting; and that’s true, but not in the sense in which you learned to count in kindergarten. Though combinatorics deals with numbering and finding out how many members are in sets, it’s designed to find ways of doing that **without actual, potentially tedious, counting** involved.\n",

    "### What's the difference between a permutation and a combination?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **permutation**, order matters. If you have a race, it matters who arrives in first, or second, or third place - there's a difference in the ordering of the group!\n",
    "\n",
    "> The number of **permutations** of **n** objects taken **r** at a time is given by the formula:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\\large P(n,r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **combination**, you only care about which items are members of the set. For example, if you're creating groups of students to work on a project, the order in which you add their names to the group doesn't really matter - it's the group members itself, not any order, that you care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The number of **combinations** of **n** objects taken **r** at a time is given by the formula:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\\large C(n,r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Main things to ask when dealing with combinations or permutations:\n",
    "- Does order matter? \n",
    "- With or without replacement? (aka does the first choice then restrict the second choice?)\n",
